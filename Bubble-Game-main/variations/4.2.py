# 4.2  In this code, we want to add fun sounds to our game!

# Your tasks:
# - Right now, the game has music and a sound when you collect a coin.
#   Let's add a new sound that plays when you bump into an obstacle.
# - The high score isn't working. Let's fix it!
#   When your score is bigger than the high score, save it in a file called highscore.txt.
#   When the game starts, read the high score from the file and show it on the screen.
#   If you get a new high score, update the file at the end of the game.
